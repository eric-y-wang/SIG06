# SIG06

### Goal
Screen single ligands and identifiy candidates for combinatorial studies in activated CD4 T cells

### Experimental Design
**Cells**: TCRb+CD4+CD44+CD62L- naive CD4 T cells were sorted from 9W old B6 mice straight from JAX and kept in autoclaved cages on DND. Mice were harvested and split into 3 biological replicates, 3F and 2M mice per group. Mice were from 5 different cages. Each group consisted of mice from each cage (to minimize cage effects influencing samples). Cells were isolated from skin-draining LNs, mesenteric LNs, and spleen. Cells were activated for 24h with 2.5 ug/mL plate-bound anti-CD3, 3 ug/mL soluble anti-CD28, and 30 U/mL hIL2. After 24h, cells were lifted from plate, washed once, and rested in cRMPI for 12h.

**Treatment**: Cells were treated in 96-well plates at 100,000 cells per well in 100 ul cRPMI. Cells were spinfected with virus or recombinant proteins 2000g x 30m and then placed into TC incubator for 6h. Edge-wells were filled with PBS during incubation. Cells were then lysed and RNA was extracted. 

**Sequencing**: RNA-seq libraries were prepared using BRB-seq with no normalization of RNA quantity. RNA-seq libraries were processed in 4 separate plates.
